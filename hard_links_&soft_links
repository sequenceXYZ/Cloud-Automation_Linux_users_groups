### Hard Links ###
----------------------
# hard links can only be created for regular files and not for directories or special files. 
# additionally, hard links cannot span across different file systems.

# Command to create hard link
ln source_file link_name
Example: ln original.txt hardlink.txt

# if you create a hard link (hardlink.txt) and then delete original.txt, the data will still be accessible through hardlink.txt. 
# The data will only be released and the space on the disk freed when the last hard link to that inode is deleted.

Example:
----------------------
# Create a file and a hard link
echo "Hello, world!" > original.txt
ln original.txt hardlink.txt

# Confirm both files exist
ls -l original.txt hardlink.txt

# Delete the original file
rm original.txt

# Confirm that the hard link still contains the data
cat hardlink.txt



----------------------
### Soft Links ###
----------------------
# symbolic links can span different file systems and can link to directories. 
# if you delete the original file (original.txt in this case), the symbolic link (symlink.txt) will be broken and won't point to anything
  
ln -s target link_name
ln -s original.txt symlink.txt
